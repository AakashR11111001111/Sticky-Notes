# Sticky Notes App

This is a simple Sticky Notes application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can create, color, and delete notes dynamically on the page.

## Features

- **Add Notes**: Write a note, choose a color, and click "Add Note" to display it on the page.
- **Choose Note Color**: Use the color picker to customize the background color of each note.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove individual notes by clicking the "x" button on each note.
- **Animations**: A subtle shake animation prompts users if the note text is empty when adding.
